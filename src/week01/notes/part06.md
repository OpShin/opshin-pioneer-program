# Homework

As we conclude this first week, we want to emphasize again the importance of engaging actively with the material rather than passively consuming it. To facilitate this active learning process, we will assign homework weekly. Since this week was primarily focused on introducing the program and setting up the envoronment, we will only have a small homework. More interesting and challenging assignments will follow in the upcoming weeks.

## Assignment

1. **Setup:** If you haven't already, make sure you've got the blockfrost setup presented in the previous lecture up and running, so you don't have to worry about it once we start with the actual smart contract development. Feel free to also play around with the alternative options of using a local node or the remote infrastructure provided by Demeter (for this, see the respective lectures of the plutus pioneer program, as described last lecture).

2. **Understand the eUTxO Model:** Make sure you have a good understanding of the eUTxO model. For such abstract topics, oftentimes, trying to explain a concept to someone else can help you check if you really understood it. So try to explain the eUTxO model to a friend or family member. If you don't have anyone to explain it to, try to write down a short summary of the eUTxO model in your own words. If you feel like you still don't have a high-leve understanding of it, consider rewatching the lecture or reading up on the topic. Details will become clearer as we dive into the practical coding sessions.

## Upcoming Sessions

Congratulations! This is the end of week 1. Starting from next week, we will dive into practical coding sessions. We will even see our first OpShin smart contract in action. Exciting times ahead, see you all next week!
