# Prompt:
# 1- Figure out what this (already finished) validator does by using all the tools at your disposal.
# 2- Write the off-chain code necessary to cover all possible interactions with the validator using
#    the off-chain tool of your choosing.
# HINT: If you get stuck, take a look at Week03's lecture
