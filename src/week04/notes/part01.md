# On-chain VS Off-chain

For this lecture, we will give a [presentation](slides/OPP_040401_On-chain_vs_Off-chain.pdf) on the topic of On-chain VS Off-chain.

In the original Plutus Pioneer Program, the remaining lectures of week 4 were dedicated to comparing off-chain code (again for the vesting example from week 3) written in the Cardano CLI (with GUI) vs. Kuber vs. Lucid. Since we've already showed how to do this in `pycardano` in week 3, we will skip this part and recommend interested pioneers to watch the PPP lectures for the specific other off-chain frameworks they additionally want to learn about.

What remains for this week is a homework assignment that we will present in [lecture 5](part05.md).
