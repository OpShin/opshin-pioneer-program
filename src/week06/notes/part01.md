# Testing OpShin Smart Contracts

## Introduction

Welcome to week 6 of the OpShin Pioneer Program, where we delve into one of the most critical aspects of blockchain development: testing smart contracts. With potentially millions of assets at stake, ensuring that contracts perform as expected is essential. This week is dedicated to equipping you with the knowledge and tools to conduct thorough testing, focusing on unit and property testing techniques.

Our journey into testing will cover the following topics:
- To begin, we introduce a mock environment that can be used for simulating blockchain states during testing. This will be a useful tool for running tests without actually having to submit transactions (e.g. to testnet).
- **Unit Testing**: Next, we will learn how to create test cases to verify the functionality of our validators when giving specific inputs, ensuring they behave as intended under the tested conditions.
- **Property Testing**: We'll explore how to use `hypothesis`, a python framework for performing property testing. This involves strategically generating a wide range of inputs to test general properties of your smart contracts, offering a broader assurance of their reliability.
- **An exciting homework challenge**: To solidify your understanding, this week's homework presents an intriguing challenge. You'll be given a smart contract with a known vulnerability. Your mission is to write tests that identify this flaw and then modify the contract to mitigate the issue.

Throughout the lesson, we emphasize practical, hands-on learning, by showing you how to perform tests for a concrete example contract.

Let's get started on this essential step in smart contract development, where thorough testing not only prevents potential losses but also builds trust in the blockchain applications we create. Happy coding, and remember, the safety and reliability of the blockchain ecosystem partly rest in your hands as a developer.
