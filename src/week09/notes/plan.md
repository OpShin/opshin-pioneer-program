# Using our Stablecoin Dapp UI

- **Part 1:** PPP video can be copied as it explains Stablecoin Dapp abstracly
- **Part 2:** should also remain the same as in PPP, just walking through the UI and explaining the different parts of the Dapp
- **Part 3-6:** goes through the code for each of the involved spending/minting scripts, swichting back and forth between on-chain and off-chain code; probably makes sense to keep stick with lucid off-chain code since we already have the UI for it (can still provide `pycardano` version as well for those who are interested)
- **Part 7:** testing the Dapp, write and present tests in `pycardano`
- **Part 8:** homework, can reuse video from PPP
